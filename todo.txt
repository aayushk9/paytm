 Frontend todo

 - /signin: when user enters some data, send that data to backend and let backend do its computation and if we get
    right response from backend navigate to /dashboard else send user a alert with what went wrong

 - /login: same for login route ------

 - /dashboard: user should be able to see exisiting user and also see a option of send money, to go further when user
    clicks on send money it would take them to /send route for a particular user they selected

 - /send should have inputs such as enter amount, enter username (whom to send) and send money (add some keys if poss 
    while sending money)
